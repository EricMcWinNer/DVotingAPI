**DvotingApp** is a prototype web application proposal to handle the Nigerian Presidential elections online built by Eric Aprioku as a final year project. The web application consists of a RESTful stateless API built on Laravel on the server-side and a React application on the front-end. This repository contains the server-side RESTful, stateless API built with Laravel. This release is the first version that works using an email address and a password to identify users. A second release would be created that would make use of fingerprint verification as an added layer of identity verification via biometrics. 

To read more about the application in general, check out the front-end repository [here](http://github.com/EricMcWinNEr/DVotingFrontend)
