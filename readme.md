**DvotingApp** is a prototype web application proposal to handle the Nigerian Presidential elections online built by Eric Aprioku as a final year project. The web application consists of a RESTful stateless API built on Laravel on the server-side and a React application on the front-end. This repository contains the server-side RESTful, stateless API built with Laravel. It uses fingerprint verification and a password to verify users identity.

To read more about the application in general, check out the front-end repository [here](http://github.com/EricMcWinNEr/DVotingFrontend)
